# ReferenceChecker

ReferenceChecker provides a quick and simple hack to check and visualise runtime dependencies across an entire directory.

Consider the code here a first cut, and the testing is a bit light.

The intent is that this can be run in an automated fashion to provide a graphical and textual log of the entry points of any runtime graphs present in a particular directory, whilst pointing out any missing assemblies.

Definitely a work in progress.
